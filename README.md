# Ringslinger Revolution

This is the official public repository for Ringslinger Revolution. If you are interested in helping out with development or have a feature you'd like implemented, please make a fork of this repo and create a pull request implementing the feature(s) so orbitalviolet and I can (potentially) officially add it to the mod.

To load the mod as is, clone the repository, then add the "src" directory using SRB2's `addfolder` console command or the `-folder` command line parameter. You may want to add a separate run configuration for folder mods if you wish to run this mod through SLADE.

Alternatively, run the buildpk3.bat (or buildpk3.sh) script and load the PK3s in the build directory in the following order:
- `ZRSR_RingslingerRevolution-v*.pk3`
- `RSR_S_TechnoMadness-v*.pk3`
- `RSR_MF_DeathmatchPack-v*.pk3`
